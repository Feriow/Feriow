ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Valter Feriow. I'm a developer in constant evolution! ðŸ˜Š 

After years of experience in other fields, I'm now working towards becoming a full-stack web developer!

I'm a certified Outsystems Associate Reactive Developer and I have also completed the IGTI Cursos Front-end development Bootcamp, which covered the basics of the 3 main front-end frameworks (Angular, React, and Vue.js). I had experience working with React Native at MÃ©liuz, and practical Outsystems experience through Experis' Outsystems Developer Bootcamp. Finally, Iâ€™m undergoing a technologist program in Computer System Analysis and Development at Faculdade EstÃ¡cio.
