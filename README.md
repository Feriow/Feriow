ğŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Valter Feriow. I'm a begginer front end developer in constant update! ğŸ˜Š 

ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently undergoing a technologist program in Computer System Analysis and Development at Faculdade EstÃ¡cio. I'm also developing my skills through IGTI Cursos Front end development bootcamp and a series of full-stack development bootcamps at Digital Innovation One. When I'm not undergoing a bootcamp I like to keep progressing on courses at Alura Cursos. ğŸŒ³
